### Installation

- Install project dependencies using: `npm install` or `yarn install`.
- Install `gulp-cli` globally using `npm install -g gulp-cli`.

### Development

- Start the server using `gulp server`. This will also compile assets for you.
- Review the designs shared with you.
- Break the components as per [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)
  into multiple templates that would be placed in the `templates` directory.
- Following the same pattern Sass can be broken into partials that can be placed in `sass` directory. For naming classes follow [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) and [BEM](http://getbem.com/).
